This repository (under construction) contains the R code to replicate the analyses performed in the paper "Exploring the Effects of COVID-19 Containment Policies on Crime: An Empirical Analysis of the Short-term  Aftermath in Los Angeles" written by me (Gian Maria Campedelli), Alberto Aziani and Serena Favarin.
